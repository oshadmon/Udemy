Suppose you had $6,000 to invest in foreign currencies plus bitcoin cash hoping that you would make a profit. 
(We won’t argue right now whether this is really a good idea. It might be in some cases, but for now we simply want to 
compare the value of bitcoin in relationship to “traditional” currencies as an exercise.)

The table below shows you how much of each currency you would have purchased if you had converted $1,000 into each of them (for a total investment of $6,000) on January 2, 2018. (Gold is presented in terms of ounces.)

| Currency         | Amount on 1/2/2018 | Amount Today | Gain/(Loss) in Dollars |
|------------------|---------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Euro             | 830.0026            | $892.83      | ($107.17)              |
| Japanese Yen     | 112,187.8473        | $752.77      | ($247.23)              |
| Chinese Yuan     | 6,493.0059          | $915.23      | ($84.77)               |
| Indian Rupee     | 63,460.8067         | $764.29      | ($235.71)              |
| Bitcoin Cash     | 2,326.8600          | $512,911.20  | $511,911.20            |
| Gold (in ounces) | 0.7591              | $1,440.29    | $440.29                |
| **Total Gained/(Lost)** |                   |              | **$512,827.03**        |


1. Overall, did you make or lose money? Made $512,827.03
2. Which of the currencies (including gold) maintained the most value over this time period? Bitcoin Cash
3. In your opinion, would you consider “holding” blockchain cash over a period of, say, one to five years or would you 
try to spend it quickly? I believe in long-term investment. I also believe that we've yet to truly see the capabilites /
utilization of crytocurrency in the wild, making thus making it a good investmnet with a higher risk.
