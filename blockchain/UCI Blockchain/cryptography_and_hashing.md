## Assignment
Considering the ways in which the blockchain system stores transaction records and keeps ownership processed and stored, 
discuss how these intricate processes occur through the Blockchain. Why is this process unique and how can it be 
transformative to industries such as financial systems, real estate transactions, and tracking inventory (such as 
supply chain systems)?

As the name states, it is a block of chains or events that occur in consecutive order. The advantage of the blockchain 
is that since the events written to it, must exist in consecutive order it is un-fungible (unable to change). In addition
every transaction on the blockchain must be verfied (via completing of complex mathematical algorithms), which then 
allow validation that the group(s) who created the content within the block (smart contract) stand by it. In layman's terms,
a smart contract is replacing legal (fees) for an agreement between individuals. 

The idea of validation by multiple sources, and decentralization allows for 2 things to happen
1. removal for government intervention whether it's financial or legal 
2. assertion of events (tracking) as an execution on the blockchain "forces" a monetary fee, which entails a gurantee 
for execution.



## Module 2 
In the past, employers wanted to see documented evidence of degrees and transcripts sent directly by the 
learning institutions. But what if a particular person has degrees plus a plethora of certificates, continuing 
education units (CEUs), and badges? Things could become quite messy! Discuss with your fellow students how the 
blockchain could possibly help in this situation
.

There's a Bay Area company called Merit, created aa platform that lets everyone access, track, and organize their 
life's achievements, with the hope of streamlining the certification. Their pitch went something like this: 
"""
Imagine you're on a trip with friends, and decide to go scuba diving, but forgot your diving log book. 
Merit will allow you to keep this record online and would be (already are) ceritified / verified by the organization 
that certified you.
"""

In theory, this is a great idea, though in practice they aren't using the blockchain, thus aren't decentralized, and 
allow individuals to update their certification(s) without any real oversight. Education is essentially the same. Yes, 
education systems give out certificate for completion, however, no one really checks (or can really check ) what's 
on a linkedin profile cause either it's not verified (example this course is offered through UCI, but is it reconginzed 
by UCI?) **or** there isn't an easy standard way of validating this information.
